# RedByte

**This project is under development.**

Through this platform you can manage, monitor, and protect computer networks using a client-server architecture.
It allows users to secure their network through a web interface, view the status of connected computers, receive real-time alerts about network attacks, and control endpoint computers.

The system is intended for organizations, businesses, and network owners who want centralized control over their network security without requiring deep technical knowledge.
